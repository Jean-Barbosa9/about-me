# About me
This document aim describing detailed which tecnologies I use daily, my portfolio, what I'm studying e my road map to step by step reach my main goal of being a complete developer and be capable to working with the full stack (Front End, Back End and mobile applications).

### My daily experience
  - git following concepts and phylosophi of git flow, to versionating a project in a organized way;
  
  - npm packages installing it's dependencies locally and globally in the machine;
  
  - Ubuntu operation system, which offers me more agility and flebility dayli;
  
  - pre processors PUG to transpile HTML and SASS to compile CSS. They together make Front End development easier, agil and flexible due to it's mixins, variables and programing logics;
  
  - webpack, but I have yet a superficial knowledge in it's configuration and functionality. Soon I'll studying it deeply;
  
  - JavaScript using Ecma2015, considering object orientation its class. I know JQuery and Vanilla JavaScript. I know work with ajax calls and fetch APIs, so I can work with promises and async await too;
  
  - JSON due to APIs body requests and responses;
  
  - My development thinking is mobile first, aiming a 100% responsive web site, always worried about code semantics and clean code, no matters if it's HTML, CSS or JS;
  
  - I've already setted a development environment, using the task manager Gulp, to compile PUG, SASS and transpile Ecma2015 to Ecma2009, garanting browsers compatibility;
  
  - I've already developed a application using Bootstrap with its both modules (CSS and JS), to focus on application logics and letting the library working as expected;
  
  - I'm using Firebase in some applications, considering user authentication, Firebase storage and its hosting services;

  ## Portfolios

  ### Projects I worked at Original io
  Beetwen may/2018 and june/2019, I worked the maintance of web sites below, that have been used Vtex platform and tecnologies as PUG, SASS and JavaScript with JQuery in its development environment, using webpack based build. All of these uses all versions (mobile, tablet and desktop):

 ### Projects I worked at Estante Virtual
 Since june/2019 we are working in a ecommerce project which uses Vtex platform too, with HTML5, SASS and JavaScript with JQuery as tecnologies. It's build is made through Gulp tasks. Soon I'll release the link.

 ## Studying

  - I studied a lot about Vuejs Framework and I consider me in a professional level, because I'm capable of using libraries to handle routes (vue router) and state management (vuex), third parties libraries like Vue Owl Carousel (carousel banners), animations and transitions with libraries like Animate CSS and JavaScript animations, components libraries as Vue Bootstrap, Event Bus instantiation, Mixins and global exports to use SASS, for example. I developed a application using the majority resources listed above and conecting it with Firebase to store data in Firestore and some backend services with Firebase Functions to read a Google Spreadsheet and send emails with OAuth2 conecting with Gmail. As soon as it's in production I'll release the link.
  
  - React using libraries to handle component styling (styled components), routes (React Router Dom), state management (Redux) and Firebase conection and state management (React Redux Firebase). I've also learned how to manage state through components, with Context API. I settup my applications with "Create React App", but it's in my road map to study webpack, so I'll can handle my own custom settings. However I consider my knowledge with React basic yet, but I've started a personal project to practice and learn more about it.

  - I've just started my studing in Flutter Framework focusing in mobile application development.

  ### Next steps:

  - Initiate Nodejs studing, focusing in a first step on API routes and middleware to handle informations and MongoDB conection;
  - Initiate MySQL studing and general concepts on relational data bases
