# About me
Here you can read about which tecnologies I'm daily working on, my portfolio, what I'm studying and my road map to improve my soft and hard skills as developer. I love technology and I'm always looking for learning new things and get updated. Right now I'm focused in learning deeper about JavaScript, to use it even on Front-End as much on Back-End, with Reactjs and Nodejs, respectivelly.

## My experience
  - git following concepts and phylosophi of git flow, to versionating a project in an organized way;
  
  - npm packages installing it's dependencies locally and globally in the machine;
  
  - Ubuntu operation system, which offers me more agility and flebility dayli;
  
  - Docker with Docker Compose;
  
  - Ruby on Rails (both FullStack and API projects);
  
  - pre processors PUG to transpile HTML and SASS to compile CSS. They together make Front End development easier, agil and flexible due to it's mixins, variables and programing logics;
  
  - webpack, but I have yet a superficial knowledge in it's configuration and functionality. Soon I'll studying it deeply;
  
  - JavaScript using Ecma2015, considering object orientation its class. I know JQuery and Vanilla JavaScript. I know work with ajax calls and fetch APIs, so I can work with promises and async await too;
  
  - JSON due to APIs body requests and responses;
  
  - My development thinking is mobile first, aiming a 100% responsive web site, always worried about code semantics and clean code, no matters if it's HTML, CSS or JS;
  
  - I've set a development environment, using the task manager Gulp, to compile PUG, SASS and transpile Ecma2015 to Ecma2009, garanting browsers compatibility;
  
  - I developed an application using Bootstrap with its both modules (CSS and JS), to focus on application logics and letting the library working as expected;
  
  - I used Firebase in some applications, considering user authentication, Firebase storage and its hosting services;
  
  - I worked with Vuejs and I can use it to build applications using libraries to handle routes (vue router) and state management (vuex), third parties libraries like Vue Owl Carousel (carousel banners), animations and transitions with libraries like Animate CSS and JavaScript animations, components libraries as Vue Bootstrap, Event Bus instantiation, Mixins and global exports to use SASS, for example. I developed an application using the majority of these resources and conecting it with Firebase, to store data in Firestore. I used some backend services with Firebase Functions, to read a Google Spreadsheet and send emails with OAuth2 conecting with Gmail.

## Portfolios

  ### Projects I worked at Original io (2018/May - 2019/June)
  Original io is a Vtex Partner Agency that implements e-Commerce's Front-End sites and offers some other services related to it. I worked maintainning this web sites listed below (which were Vtex clients). Technologies used: PUG, SASS and JavaScript with JQuery in its development environment, using webpack based build. All of these uses all versions (mobile, tablet and desktop):

 ### Projects I worked at Estante Virtual (2019/June - 2022/June)
 Estante Virtual is an online marketplace that is used to sell used and new books. Any one can register her/him self as a seller and create the books to be sold on Estante Virtual online store. It was bouhgt by Magazine Luiza at 2020 January and now is part of it's group.
 
 Here are a summary of projects that I worked on:
 
 - <a href="https://www3.livrariacultura.com.br/" target="_blank">Livraria Cultura</a>: An ecommerce project that uses Vtex platform as backend, with HTML5, SASS and JavaScript with JQuery on it's frontend. It was built using Gulp tasks.
 - Backoffice admin panels: All admin panels used by sellers (to manage account, books registrations, sales and more) and internal teams (to manage many administrative routines). Technologies used: Nuxt, Ruby on Rails and Django;
 - Integrations with Magazine Luiza: Back-End integrations between Estante Virtual and Magazine Luiza services, to create new features to Estante Virtual sellers and guaranteeing the needed communications between both companies. Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, Django and Fast API;
 - Internal automation workflows: We developed some automations to help administrative teams to get the job done more easily, avoiding human errors and saving time.

### Personal projects
I'm working in a personal project using Ruby on Rails to build a blog with a admin panel. As soon as I had it's link, I'll insert it here.

 ## Studying
 
  - React using both class based and hooks, some libraries to handle component styling (styled components), routes (React Router Dom), state management (Redux). I used to use Context API when the application needs doesn't require Redux and I setup using "Create React App" CLI, but I'm going to start to use Vite to learn more about this new tendency.
  - Nextjs (React Framework for Server Side Rendering) integrated with GraphQL.
  - Nojejs to build API Rest or GraphQL, integrating it with some database. I'm thinking about using it's template rendering, to play a little with it's possibilities.
  - TypeScript (both in React and Node);
  - Strapi (Headless CMS) integrated with GraphQL, database, some email service and file upload service (AWS S3 like).

  ### Next steps:
  - Go deeper in automated tests (probably using React Testing Library and Jest)
  - CI/CD
  - Cloud Services
  - Go deeper with relational databases
  - React Native
